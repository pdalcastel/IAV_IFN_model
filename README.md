To run the simulation, first install CC3D from the website:
https://compucell3d.org/SrcBin
Follow the instructions carefully. Pay attention to version, operation system specificity, installation directory etc.

If the installation is successful, you will have installed the Twedit and the Player. Open Twedit. In my case, in Windows, I type Twedit in the search bar and press enter.

Download the simulation folder. Open it in twedit by going to CC3D Project > Open CC3D Project. Navigate to the simulation folder and open the file "IAV_IFN_w_comments.cc3d".

Three files are shown: the one with extension .XML with basic specifications, and two with extension .py. The last python file, called "steppables", contains most of the mechanisms governing the simulation.

Now RIGHT CLICK the project in the Project Panel and hit "Open in Player".

If the simulation does not run immediately, press the "Play" button.
